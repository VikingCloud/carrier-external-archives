# external-source-archives

An internal place to store 3rd party source code necessary to build Carrier.

This project is public so that the carrier-build project can reference these
archives without authentication. The source code found in this repo should be
publicly available anyway, so there shouldn't be any concern about leaking
VikingCloud private data.

Please do not delete source code archives from this repository as it can break
building older versions of Carrier.
